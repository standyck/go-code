* Go Language Notes
  Let's see if we can embed some go code:

  #+BEGIN_SRC golang
  package main

  import "fmt"

  func main() {
     fmt.Println("Hello, 世界")
  }
  #+END_SRC

  Looks like it isn't supported natively. I didn't find anything via search

  I can link to code though which is probably more in line with what I want:

  This is [[./main.go][main.go]] which is a go file.
